      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <section class="terms-content">
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By accessing and using this website or purchasing products from Mach Five Wheels, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, our Privacy Policy, and any other applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree, please do not use this site.</p>

<h2>2. Product Customization & Fitment</h2>
<p>All Mach Five Wheels products are custom-engineered and manufactured to order based on the vehicle specifications and preferences you provide. It is your responsibility to ensure that all submitted information—including wheel size, offset, bolt pattern, center bore, and brake clearance—is accurate. We are not responsible for incorrect fitment due to inaccurate information provided by the customer.</p>

<h2>3. Order Process</h2>
<p>All orders require full payment at the time of checkout unless otherwise agreed upon. Once an order is placed and confirmed, changes may not be possible due to the custom nature of our manufacturing process. Lead times are estimates only and may vary depending on material availability, production queue, and finish selection.</p>

<h2>4. Shipping</h2>
<p>Shipping costs are calculated at checkout or invoiced separately. All products are shipped via insured freight or ground service with tracking. Mach Five Wheels is not liable for shipping delays, damages, or lost shipments once the product has left our facility. Any damage claims must be filed with the carrier within 48 hours of delivery.</p>

<h2>5. Returns & Cancellations</h2>
<p>Due to the bespoke nature of our products, all sales are final. No cancellations, returns, or exchanges will be accepted after production has begun. In rare cases where cancellation is requested and granted prior to machining, a non-refundable fee of 30% may apply to cover engineering, processing, and material allocation costs.</p>

<h2>6. Warranty</h2>
<p>We offer a limited lifetime structural warranty on all forged wheels against material and manufacturing defects under normal use. Finish warranties vary by coating type but typically extend for one (1) year. Damage caused by road hazards, improper installation, neglect, chemical exposure, or track use (except in carefully reviewed circumstances) is not covered.</p>

<h2>7. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Mach Five Wheels shall not be held liable for any damages, injuries, or losses resulting from improper installation, misapplication, racing use, or use beyond recommended specifications. It is your responsibility to ensure professional mounting, balancing, and torqueing by qualified technicians.</p>

<h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All content, imagery, designs, logos, and technology on this site are the exclusive intellectual property of Mach Five Wheels and may not be copied, reproduced, or distributed without written permission. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited and enforceable under applicable law.</p>

<h2>9. Pricing & Availability</h2>
<p>All prices are listed in USD and subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to adjust pricing, discontinue products, or modify specifications without prior notice. Promotions and discounts may not be applied retroactively.</p>

<h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Massachusetts, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved exclusively in the courts located in Worcester, Massachusetts.</p>
