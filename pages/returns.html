      <section class="terms-content">

        <h2>1. All Sales Final</h2>
        <p>Due to the custom and made-to-order nature of our products, all sales are final. Once an order has been submitted and production has begun, no changes, cancellations, or refunds will be granted. In select situations, and at the discretion of Mach Five Wheels, popular styles in common sizes may be returned for a fee.</p>

        <h2>2. Cancellation Requests</h2>
        <p>If a cancellation request is submitted <strong>before machining begins</strong>, Mach Five Wheels may approve the request at our discretion. A non-refundable fee of up to 30% may be applied to cover design, processing, and material allocation costs.</p>

        <h2>3. Incorrect Fitment or Vehicle Details</h2>
        <p>It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that all vehicle specs—including size, offset, bolt pattern, and brake clearance—are accurate before finalizing the order. We are not responsible for fitment issues caused by incorrect customer information.</p>

        <h2>4. Manufacturing Errors</h2>
        <p>If a manufacturing error occurs on our end (i.e., incorrect machining or finish that does not match the spec sheet), we will correct the issue at no cost. Claims must be submitted within 7 days of delivery and include detailed photos of the wheels and any markings. Photos are taken before each set leaves the production facility, and will be referenced during this time.</p>

        <h2>5. Damage During Shipping</h2>
        <p>Any damage incurred during shipping must be reported within 48 hours of delivery. Be sure to inspect all packages upon receipt and photograph any visible damage. We will assist in filing claims with the shipping carrier but are not liable for damage post-delivery.</p>

        <h2>6. Return Authorization</h2>
        <p>No products may be returned without prior written authorization from Mach Five Wheels. Unauthorized returns will be rejected. All approved returns must be in unused, unmounted condition and shipped back in original packaging at the customer’s expense.</p>

        <h2>7. Refunds or Credits</h2>
        <p>In extremely rare cases where a refund is granted, it will be issued via the original payment method minus any non-refundable fees. Refunds are not issued for custom finishes, engraving, or expedited services. We are not able to refund wheels that have custom engraving, or that have been damaged from customer neglect.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact for Exceptions</h2>
        <p>We understand that every build is unique. If you believe your case qualifies for an exception, contact us through our <a href="/pages/contact.html">contact page</a> with your order number and a detailed explanation.</p>
