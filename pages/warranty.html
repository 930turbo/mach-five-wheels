      <h1>Warranty</h1>
      <p>At Mach Five Wheels, we stand behind the quality of our forged wheels. All coverage is subject to the terms and limitations below.</p>
      <section class="terms-content">

        <h2>1. Structural Warranty</h2>
        <p>We provide a limited lifetime warranty against structural defects in materials and workmanship for forged wheels purchased through us or an authorized dealer. This warranty applies only under normal, intended driving conditions and is our sole obligation for structural issues.</p>

        <h2>2. Finish Warranty</h2>
        <p>Each wheel finish carries a one-year warranty from the date of delivery against clear-coat peeling, powder-coat separation, and excessive discoloration under normal care. Improper cleaning or use of harsh chemicals, abrasives, or non-pH-neutral products is expressly excluded from this coverage.</p>

        <h2>3. Warranty Conditions</h2>
        <p>To qualify for warranty service, the wheels must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remain unaltered and fitted on the originally intended vehicle</li>
          <li>Be installed and torqued by certified professionals</li>
          <li>Maintained with proper cleaning and care (pH-neutral products only)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Exclusions</h2>
        <p>This warranty does not cover damage caused by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improper installation or incorrect torque</li>
          <li>Off-road use, racing, or track abuse (case specific exemptions may apply)</li>
          <li>Chemical exposure (acidic cleaners, brake dust corrosion)</li>
          <li>Impact with curbs, potholes, or road debris</li>
          <li>Improper mounting or dismounting of tires</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Warranty Claims</h2>
        <p>To submit a warranty claim, contact our support team through the <a href="/pages/contact.html">contact page</a>. Claims must include proof of purchase, photos of the issue, and details on installation and use. Wheels must be returned for inspection at customer’s expense if requested.</p>

        <h2>6. Replacement Terms</h2>
        <p>If a warranty claim is approved, Mach Five Wheels will repair or replace the affected product at our discretion. If the original finish or design is unavailable, a comparable product may be substituted. Warranty does not cover labor, vehicle downtime, or shipping costs.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Our liability is limited solely to the repair or replacement of wheels proven defective under warranty. We are not responsible for incidental or consequential damages, including loss of use, loss of time, or vehicle damage.</p>
